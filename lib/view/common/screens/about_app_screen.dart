  /*final String description = "   Mrs Amita Patel , founder and designer of vulcal established the studio in 1993 , intending to provide beautiful , high-quality "
        "fashion in Vadodara. As a student of fine arts, she always had an eye for colours, patterns, textures and so on. Moreover, with some basic "
        "knowledge about textiles, she started Vulcal. \n\n   Vulcal is a prominent name when it comes to traditional Indian chaniya choli. Thus, after so many "
        "years of hard work in the same field, Amita Patel aims to provide the high quality fashion for the customer. It is noteworthy to mention that as "
        "per Amita the utmost crucial aspect while working with constantly changing trends of the present time is the maintenance of quality. We work with "
        "the finest details to make our outfit standout. Furthermore, we believe in holding the ground of tradition when it comes to fashion. Also, we are "
        "delighted to share that we have entered the 30th glorious year of our fashion studio.\n\n   \"It's a  journey from a thought process moulded into reality "
        "with persistent efforts of our team\", says Amita Patel. Here at Vulcal, we suppose that every outfit has its own story, an inspiration, a motivation,"
        "a memory and an emotion attached to it. We try our best to bring the touch of those facts in our designs more particularly in a way that captures "
        "the heart of the wearer. \n\n   Preferentially, we not only give our 100% to make a  beautiful outfit but also to make a beautiful memory for the wearer."
        " Vulcal studio offers a wide range of womenâ€™s wear from casual Indian dresses, to bridal lehangas. Additionally, customized clothing for both bride "
        "and groom as well as other family members is available.";*/
